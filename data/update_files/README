---------------------
Uses the Gene_data.tab file to create the following tables

GeneData:
	Holds the gene expression across cell types, not currently used in any charts. Has the following schema:
		geneID (text)
		[HSSM.longNonPolyA - GM12878.longPolyA] (double)

TransData:
	Holds transcript expression across cell types, used in both the Entropy Expression and Transcript Expression charts on the data.php page. This table has the following schema:
		
		geneID (text)
		transID (text)
		chromosome (int)
		low (int)
		high (int)
		[HSSM.longNonPolyA - GM12878.longPolyA] (double)
		entropyExpr (double)
		sumExpr (double)
		varianceExpr (double)
		minExpr (double)
		maxExpr (double)
		maxExprType (text)
		threeTimesRest (text)
		tissSpec (double) 
	Note: Gene Coordinates are split into three parts: chromosome, low, high, for simplicity in searching.

PCAData:
	Holds all 32 component data for the PCA Data chart located on the main search.html page. This table has the following schema:
		gene_id (text)
		[Comp.1 - Comp.32] (double)
